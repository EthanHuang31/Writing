As a distraction, Niki hacks into the jail alarm system. The warden immediately hears the alarm going off and sends 25 guards to check in on all the cells. Ranboo uses this time break into the Daves cell but is interupted by the guards. He turns into a gas like entity and slithers under the guards foot, he reapears behind them then he reforms into a human like creature but he has no face. The entire hallway turns dark and all cameras are no longer showing what the prisno is, but only a dark screen and a grin and two eyes. Ranboo finally breaks the cell door. "You're late" the man in the cell said. "I don't have time for this mysterious voice saying I'm late" Ranboo called out. Ranboo grabbed the other man and shifted back into his gas form and slithers in a super fast speed back into their base. Niki teleports back into her own room. "How did it go?" Phil asked the three of them. "It went very smoothly, am I right Dade?"Ranboo asks him in a mocking voice "yeah yeah yeah whatever"
